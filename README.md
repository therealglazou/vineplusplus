# Vine++
A Vine helper Web extension

A while ago, Amazon decided to "promote" me to their "Vine testing club" after one of my product reviews attracted dozens of positive feedback. The Amazon Vine web page is pretty basic and can be, sorry to say, sometimes painful. Many things are missing in that page but the two first ones are

1. when the description of an item is truncated because it's too long, it's impossible to get the longer/full version; Vine++ fixes that issue, juste hover the over the truncated description.
2. no search box... When you look for a given type of item and the Vine sector you're browsing has 400 items, it's a nightmare. The search filter is preserved across web pages and sessions.

To install for instance in Chrome, open the Extensions tab in your browser. Enable the Developer mode. Install the extension as Unpacked, selecting the directory you cloned the repo into. Done. Everything will be automatic when you browse a Vine page.
